# Lab Report: Comparison of Virtual Machines (VMs) and Containers

---

## **1. Objective**
The primary goals of this experiment are:
* To understand the conceptual and practical differences between Virtual Machines (VMs) and Containers.
* To install and configure an Ubuntu-based Nginx web server using both VirtualBox/Vagrant and Docker inside WSL.
* To compare resource utilization, performance, and operational characteristics of both environments.

---

## **2. Hardware and Software Requirements**
### **Hardware**
* 64-bit system with virtualization support enabled in BIOS.
* Minimum 8 GB RAM (4 GB acceptable).
* Internet connection.

### **Software**
* Oracle VirtualBox and Vagrant.
* Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2) with Ubuntu distribution.
* Docker Engine (docker.io).

## **3. Theory**
| Feature | Virtual Machine (VM) | Container |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Virtualization Level** | Emulates complete hardware and kernel. | Virtualizes at the OS level, sharing the host kernel. |
| **Isolation** | Strong (Full OS isolation). | Moderate (Process-level isolation). |
| **Resource Usage** | Higher (Requires dedicated RAM/CPU for guest OS). | Lightweight and efficient. |
| **Startup Time** | Slower (Minutes/Seconds). | Fast (Milliseconds/Seconds). |

## **4. Experiment Setup - Part A: Virtual Machine**

### **Step 1: Initialization and Deployment**
Using Vagrant, an Ubuntu VM was initialized and started.
* **Command:** `vagrant init ubuntu/jammy64` followed by `vagrant up`.

> **Observation:** The system downloads the base box (Ubuntu Jammy) and configures the VirtualBox provider. Port forwarding (2222 -> 22) is established.

### **Step 2: Accessing the VM (SSH)**
Once the VM was up, we established a connection to the guest OS.
* **Command:** `vagrant ssh`

)
> **Observation:** Successful login to the Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS environment.

### **Step 3: Installing Nginx**
Inside the VM terminal, the package lists were updated, and the Nginx web server was installed.
* **Commands:** `sudo apt update`, `sudo apt install -y nginx`

> **Observation:** The `apt` package manager retrieves necessary archives. This process is slower than Docker as it installs dependencies for a full OS environment.

### **Step 4: Verification Inside VM**
We verified the server was running locally within the guest OS.
* **Command:** `curl localhost`

![VM Internal Verification](Screenshots/4.jpeg)
> **Observation:** The `curl` command inside the VM returns the full HTML source of the "Welcome to nginx!" page.

## **5. Experiment Setup - Part B: Containers (Docker)**

### **Step 1: Running the Container**
The Docker engine was used to pull the Ubuntu image and deploy a containerized Nginx instance.
* **Command:** `docker run -dp 8080:80 --name nginx-container nginx`

![Docker Pull and Run](Screenshots/5.jpeg)
> **Observation:** Docker pulls the image layers and starts the container nearly instantaneously.

### **Step 2: Verification**
The Nginx server was verified by accessing the mapped port on the localhost.
* **Command:** `curl localhost:8080`

![Nginx Container Verification](Screenshots/6.jpeg)
> **Observation:** The `curl` command confirms the Nginx "Welcome" page is active on port 8080.

## **6. Resource Utilization & Comparison**

This section uses specific metrics captured during the experiment to contrast the two technologies.

### **A. Boot Time Analysis**
* **Metric:** Time taken to reach a usable state.
* **VM Command:** `systemd-analyze`

![VM Boot Time Analysis](Screenshots/7.png)
> **Observation (VM):** The VM took **36.819 seconds** to finish startup (6.9s kernel + 29.8s userspace).
> **Observation (Container):** The container started in **less than 1 second** (refer to Docker output in Sec 5).

### **B. Process Overhead & Isolation**
* **Metric:** Number of background processes required to run the application.
* **VM Command:** `htop`

![VM Htop Process List](Screenshots/8.png)
> **Observation (VM):** `htop` reveals a heavy process tree. Even though we only want Nginx, the VM is running `systemd`, `snapd`, `rsyslogd`, `polkitd`, and `sshd`. There are dozens of tasks running to support the OS.

![Docker Stats](Screenshots/9.png)
> **Observation (Container):** `docker stats` shows the container uses minimal resources because it *only* runs the application process (Nginx) and its direct dependencies.

### **C. Memory Usage**
* **Metric:** RAM consumption.

![VM Memory Usage](Screenshots/10.png)
> **Observation (VM):** The `free -h` command inside the VM shows it has allocated **957Mi** total, with **196Mi** used immediately by the OS kernel and services.

> **Observation (Container):** Referring to the Docker Stats image above, the container consumes only **13.22MiB** of RAM.

### **Comparison Summary Table**

| Parameter | Virtual Machine (VM) | Container (Docker) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Boot Time** | **~36.8 seconds** (Measured) | **< 1 second** |
| **RAM Usage** | **~196 MiB** (Base OS overhead) | **~13.22 MiB** (App only) |
| **Background Processes**| High (init, systemd, ssh, logs) | Low (only Nginx entrypoint) |
| **Disk Usage** | Larger (Full OS libraries) | Smaller (Layered Image) |

## **7. Conclusion**
The experiment validates that **Containers** are significantly more lightweight.
1.  **Speed:** The Docker container started instantly, whereas the VM required nearly 37 seconds to boot.
2.  **Efficiency:** The VM required ~200MB of RAM just to exist, while the containerized application ran comfortably on ~13MB.
3.  **Complexity:** The `htop` analysis clearly shows that VMs run a full operating system stack, creating unnecessary overhead for single-application deployments.

Therefore, Containers are ideal for microservices and rapid scaling, while VMs are better suited for scenarios requiring full hardware simulation or complete OS isolation.

## **8. Viva Voce Answers**
1.  **Main Difference:** VMs virtualize hardware (slow, heavy); containers virtualize the OS (fast, light).
2.  **Fast Startup:** Containers use the host kernel and don't need to boot a new OS, saving the ~30s kernel/userspace init time seen in the VM.
3.  **Hypervisor Role:** The hypervisor (VirtualBox) manages the VM's access to hardware.
4.  **Different Kernels:** Containers share the host kernel. VMs run their own kernel.
5.  **Why use `htop`?** To visualize the process tree and see that a VM runs many system services (systemd, journald) that a container does not.
